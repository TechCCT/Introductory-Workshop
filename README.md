![TechCCT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechCCT/TechCCT.github.io/master/images/github-logo.jpg)


## Welcome!
This is a friendly introduction to Github – a free and open source platform that can help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled.

In this workshop we will introduce you to the Github ecosystem and help you get you comfortable navigating basic Github workflows. We will make sure that you leave the workshop aware of the best practices for developing projects on Github (e.g. writing a good “readme” or posting and labeling issues) and an understanding of how Github can help make your projects more readable and accessible. We'll also introduce working locally and some of the command line options so you're ready to use these workflows in your day to day life!

`This workshop is developed for anyone looking for a solution to making projects – whether it be your research on arctic glaciers, the materials for an undergraduate course, your Project report, or even a cookbook – more manageable.` This workshop is geared towards all skill levels, but first-time and novice users are encouraged and prioritized.

# Presentations

**1. What, Why, and Welcome to Github -** In this short presentation, we'll get a brief intro to what GitHub is and some handy terms which well help get you speaking the language of Git/Github.

**2. Working collaboratively with GitHub -** In the previous talk, we saw how individually you might work on projects, this talk will show you two pathways for collaborating on GitHub.

**3. Working locally using git -** In the real world you'll probably want to work on your own computer and then keep the versions on GitHub. In this presentation we show you a sample workflow for keeping track of everything you've done.

**4. More things you can do with GitHub -** Here we go through the essential components of a Github Repository. We talk specifically about: readme's, how people can contribute to your project, the code of conduct for your project/community, and licensing your project.


# Exercises
**1. My First Repo:** Make your own repository on GitHub and experiment with issues, branches, commit messages and pull requests.

**2. My First Pull Request:** Jumping in with your very first open source contribution! Work in pairs to edit a file in your partner's GitHub repository using a pull request.

**3. Working Locally:** Add a repository from your own computer and keep it synced with the version online at GitHub.
