# Introductory Github Workshop

![TechCCT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechCCT/TechCCT.github.io/master/images/github-logo.jpg)


## Welcome!
This is a friendly introduction to Github – a free and open source platform that can help you build projects that are collaborative, well documented, and version-controlled.

In this workshop we will introduce you to the Github ecosystem and help you get you comfortable navigating basic Github workflows. We will make sure that you leave the workshop aware of the best practices for developing projects on Github (e.g. writing a good “readme” or posting and labeling issues) and an understanding of how Github can help make your projects more readable and accessible. We'll also introduce working locally and some of the command line options so you're ready to use these workflows in your day to day life!

`This workshop is developed for anyone looking for a solution to making projects – whether it be your research on arctic glaciers, the materials for an undergraduate course, your Project report, or even a cookbook – more manageable.` This workshop is geared towards all skill levels, but first-time and novice users are encouraged and prioritized.
